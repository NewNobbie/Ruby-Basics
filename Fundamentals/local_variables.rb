# Define variables
price = 100
discount_percentage = 20

# Calculate the discount amount
discount = price * discount_percentage / 100

# Calculate the total price after discount
total_price = price - discount

# Output the result
puts "The total price after a #{discount_percentage}% discount is: #{total_price}"
